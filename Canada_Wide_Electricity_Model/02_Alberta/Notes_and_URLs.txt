The source file was originally taken from the following URL: 

https://www.aeso.ca/market/market-and-system-reporting/data-requests/hourly-metered-volumes-and-pool-price-and-ail-data-2008-to-2020/

The comma separated values (.csv) file was converted to an Excel spreadsheet
without changing any data.

The Excel spreadsheet was read by the AB_Spreadsheet_Files.py application,
the date and time information, along with the Alberta Internal Load (AIL),
was extracted, and the data written to the load_db_AB.txt file.
