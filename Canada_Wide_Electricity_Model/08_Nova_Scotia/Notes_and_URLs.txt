Nova Scotia 2020 load data was extracted as screen shots of
each months expanded view from:
https://wetmore.ca/nspower/?P=NSLoad&I=365

This website compiles data at 5 minute intervals from the Nova Scotia Power
public website.

These screen shots were then converted to data values using 
the WebPlotDigitizer tool found at https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/.
The "Averaging Window" algorithm was used, with a
delta X of 1 pixel and a delta y of 1 pixel.

Additional processing, as embodied in NS_Spreadsheet_files.py, was necessary
to convert mutiple data points to a single data value for each hour.

Only the first 11 months of data are available for 2020.  
December 2020 values will be added in the new year.

Data was captured using the following command:
./NS_Spreadsheet_Files.py -a -y 2020 > load_db_NS.txt
