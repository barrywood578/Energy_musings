Quebec 2014 load data was extracted from the chart on PDF page 14, document page 3
of expanding-ontario-and-quebec-tx-interties-final-report-june-16-2016.pdf.

Daily demand curve information was extracted from the diagram on page 7
of electricity-supply-plan-2020-2029.pdf found on the HydroQuebec
website, www.hydroquebec.com

Data was extracted using the WebPlotDigitizer tool found at
https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/.
- The "Averaging Window" algorithm was used, with a
  delta X of 1 pixel and a delta y of 1 pixel.

The load min/max and curve data is used to generate the load file using
the following command:

./PQ_Spreadsheet_Files.py -i QuebecDemand_Partial_Lower_Line.csv -i QuebecDemand_Partial_Lower_Line_ON_overlap.csv -a QuebecDemand_Upper_Line.csv -y 2014 -a QuebecDemand_Upper_Supplemental.csv -c Quebec_Daily_Demand_Curve_2019_Jan_22.csv > load_db_PQ.txt

Example output is:
INFO:root:Parsed .csv file QuebecDemand_Partial_Lower_Line.csv
INFO:root:Parsed .csv file QuebecDemand_Partial_Lower_Line_ON_overlap.csv
INFO:root:Parsed .csv file QuebecDemand_Upper_Line.csv
INFO:root:Parsed .csv file QuebecDemand_Upper_Supplemental.csv
INFO:root:Parsed .csv file Quebec_Daily_Demand_Curve_2019_Jan_22.csv

Note that since the daily demand curve was extracted for a cold day
in January, the load db cannot be considered functionally accurate.
I've been promised that Quebec will publish daily demand
curve statistics "early" in 2021.
