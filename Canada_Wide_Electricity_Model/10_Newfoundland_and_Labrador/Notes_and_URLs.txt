Newfoundland and Labrador load data was extracted from the PDFs provided
at http://www.pub.nl.ca/applications/IslandInterconnectedSystem/DemandStatusReports.htm.

NOTE : It may be necessary to remove any cached copy of 
       www.pub.nl.ca/applications/IslandInterconnectedSystem/DemandStatusReports.htm
       before updating this directory.

The PDFs were downloaded with the following command:
wget -r -c -l 2 --limit-rate=30k http://www.pub.nl.ca/applications/IslandInterconnectedSystem/DemandStatusReports.htm

The demand file was extracted from the resulting directory, www.pub.nl.ca,
using the following command:

./NL_pdf_files.py -d www.pub.nl.ca -l > load_db.txt 2> example_output.txt

As per the above, example output can be found in "example_output.txt"

Note : for debugging purposes, the "-a" flag can be added to the command line above.
       This will output a .png file for every processed PDF.
       The .png file has various measurement points marked/annotated.

Note : the accuracy of the measurements have not been maximized.
       They are "close enough", generally to within +/- 5 MW.
