Prince Edward Island 2020 load data was extracted as screen shots of
each months expanded view from:
https://wetmore.ca/peipower/?P=Load&I=365

This website compiles data at 5 minute intervals from the Prince Edward Island
government public website.

These screen shots were then converted to data values using 
the WebPlotDigitizer tool found at https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/.
The "Averaging Window" algorithm was used, with a
delta X of 1 pixel and a delta y of 1 pixel.
A project file, which preserves the XY axis calibration, was used to ensure that
Load and Wind files used exactly the same calibration.

Additional processing, as embodied in PEI_Spreadsheet_files.py, was necessary
to convert mutiple data points to a single data value for each hour.

Only the first 11 months of data are available for 2020.  
December 2020 values will be added in the new year.

Data was captured using the following command:
./PEI_Spreadsheet_Files.py -y 2020 -c PEI_Load_2020_01.csv -c PEI_Load_2020_02.csv -c PEI_Load_2020_03.csv -c PEI_Load_2020_04.csv -c PEI_Load_2020_05.csv -c PEI_Load_2020_06.csv -c PEI_Load_2020_07.csv -c PEI_Load_2020_08.csv -c PEI_Load_2020_09.csv -c PEI_Load_2020_10.csv -c PEI_Load_2020_11.csv > load_db_PEI.txt

Also captured was wind generation data for PEI, using the following command:
./PEI_Spreadsheet_Files.py -y 2020 -c PEI_Wind_2020_01.csv -c PEI_Wind_2020_02.csv -c PEI_Wind_2020_03.csv -c PEI_Wind_2020_04.csv -c PEI_Wind_2020_05.csv -c PEI_Wind_2020_06.csv -c PEI_Wind_2020_07.csv -c PEI_Wind_2020_08.csv -c PEI_Wind_2020_09.csv -c PEI_Wind_2020_10.csv -c PEI_Wind_2020_11.csv > wind_gen_db_PEI.txt
