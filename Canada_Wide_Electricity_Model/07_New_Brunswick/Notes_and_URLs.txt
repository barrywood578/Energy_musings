All demand files were taken from the following URL:

https://tso.nbpower.com/Public/en/system_information_archive.aspx

Some demand files had "NA" measurements.  The measurements
were replaced with values interpolated between the last and
next known values.

The load file is generated with the following command:
./NB_Spreadsheet_Files.py -a > load_db_NB.txt
